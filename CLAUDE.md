# ddwrt — Agent Operating Guide

Native OpenTofu/Terraform provider for **DD-WRT routers** driven over **SSH**.
Sibling of `../tofu-tomato`, `../tofu-aruba-aos`, and `../openwrt-ubus` (same
generic-over-the-device philosophy, same toolchain). The workspace-root
`../CLAUDE.md` applies; this adds specifics.

## What this is / isn't

- **Is:** a provider for DD-WRT firmware (the Broadcom/Atheros third-party
  firmware), managing **NVRAM** generically over SSH.
- **Isn't:** an OpenWrt provider (that's `../openwrt-ubus`, ubus-over-HTTP), a
  Tomato provider (that's `../tofu-tomato` — different service-control verbs),
  or a REST provider — DD-WRT has no clean REST API.

## Transport — SSH, and why (decision record)

DD-WRT keeps all config in **NVRAM**. Two transports were considered:

- **HTTP (httpd):** Basic-auth web UI; writes POST `var=value` form fields to
  `/apply.cgi` with `submit_button` / `action` / `service`. Writing is workable.
  **Reading is the dealbreaker:** there is no CGI that returns a single NVRAM
  value; status pages embed values inside inline JavaScript, so a read means
  scraping + per-build parsing.
- **SSH (Dropbear):** `nvram get <k>` / `nvram set k=v` / `nvram unset k` /
  `nvram commit` / `stopservice`/`startservice <svc>` / `rc restart`. Reads are
  exact and structured for **any** variable, firmware-independent.

The manage-declared-only subset model **needs** an exact read of each declared
key to compute a 0-diff on import. HTTP cannot give that cleanly; SSH gives it
trivially. **SSH is therefore the strictly cleaner transport for a generic
NVRAM resource — that is the chosen transport.**

We invoke the **system `ssh` binary** via `os/exec` (not an in-process SSH
library). This (a) keeps the module dependency set byte-for-byte unchanged — no
`golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` — per the build constraint, and (b) reuses the lab's
existing SSH machinery: Dropbear key auth or OpenBao-signed SSH certs live in
`ssh_config`/agent exactly as for every other lab host, so the provider never
handles a private key. `ssh -o BatchMode=yes` ensures it fails fast instead of
hanging on a prompt (cf. the prod-lab "net-routers plan shell SSH hang" lesson).

## Service control — DD-WRT differs from Tomato/Asuswrt (decision record)

DD-WRT has **no `service <svc> restart`** (that is Tomato) and **no
`restart_<svc>`** (that is Asuswrt/Merlin). It exposes:

- `stopservice <svc>` / `startservice <svc>` — cycle one named service, and
- `rc restart` — re-run the entire service init (the safe "apply NVRAM" idiom).

So the restart form is a **provider-level configurable template**
(`restart_command`, default `stopservice {service}; startservice {service}`).
The resource's `restart` attribute names the service; `*`/`all`/`rc` short-
circuit to a full `rc restart` regardless of the template. Empty `restart` is a
no-op (keys read live / applied on reboot).

## Design tenets

- **The generic resource is `ddwrt_nvram`** (+ data source). `keys` is a JSON
  object of the NVRAM variables managed; everything else in NVRAM is left alone.
- **The subset plan modifier is `nvramSubsetMatches`** — declared keys all match
  device → 0-diff; otherwise the drift surfaces as an update. NVRAM is
  stringly-typed, so values are compared as strings.
- **Restore-on-destroy is exact.** `previous` snapshots each managed key's prior
  value (or absence) at create/import; destroy restores set→value or
  unset→gone, then commits + restarts.
- **`nvram get` cannot distinguish unset from set-empty** (both print nothing),
  so `GetNVRAM` probes `nvram show` for `key=` to return a correct `present`.

## Toolchain

- Go 1.26.4 (`/home/jameson/.local/go`), `terraform-plugin-framework` v1.19.0.
- **Do not add or bump dependencies** — the SSH transport shells out precisely
  so `go.mod` stays unchanged. Versions are reused from `../tofu-tomato`.
- Provider address: `registry.terraform.io/jamesonrgrieve/ddwrt`. Binary:
  `terraform-provider-ddwrt`. Single-token TypeName `ddwrt` so resources are
  `ddwrt_nvram` (the Go module / repo carry the `tofu-` prefix).
- `make check` = tidy + fmt + vet + test + build; `.githooks/pre-commit` re-runs
  the gate. Never `--no-verify`.

## Hard rules

- **No secrets in the repo.** Creds come from the provider config / ssh_config
  (OpenBao-signed certs via the lab's normal SSH path).
- **Lab target is change-windowed / off.** The DD-WRT lab VM is powered off;
  build + unit-test only. Do not power it on or run live acceptance tests.
- Drive any future live changes via Semaphore, plan-first, 0-diff.
